SoundSpeed with Arduino
=======================

Introduction
------------

This is the result of a 3-days course for High School teachers on *Physics with Arduino and smartphone* at [University "La Sapienza" in Rome, Physics Department](https://www.phys.uniroma1.it/fisica/en), in collaboration with the FabLab [Fondazione Mondo Digitale](http://mondodigitale.org/en). 

Description
-----------
This work aims to measure the sound speed in air as a temperature function. In particular, is an educationa tool to demonstrate the linear approximation in the temperature range of -10°C to 60°C. 
We measure the sound speed with an ultrasonic sensor, deriving it by the time that sound waves takes to cover a certain distance. This due to a box in which me put the sensor, so we can measure both sound speed and temperature of a quite definite portion of air.



What we needs?
--------------
For this work we use:
* Arduino Uno Rev.3
* Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
* Temperature sensor TMP36
* Wood box 15x20x10 cm
* Felt
* Dehumidifiers salts
* Hair dryer
